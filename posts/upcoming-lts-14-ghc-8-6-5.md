The stackage curator team has started preparations for an LTS major
bump which will include ghc-8.6.5. This is _not a change_ in GHC
version number from the current LTS 13 series. In addition to allowing
new, breaking changes of packages into an LTS release, this LTS 14
will be the first LTS using the [new curator
tool](https://www.stackage.org/blog/2019/07/new-snapshot-format).

To give everyone some time to prepare, we are announcing the planned release date
as approximately **two to four weeks** from the date of this post.

Getting your package into the nightly snapshot will ensure its inclusion
in LTS 14 as well. To add your package, please submit a PR to
[commercialhaskell/stackage](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage).
To add your package to LTS 14 after it's released, please open a new issue
on [commercialhaskell/lts-haskell](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/lts-haskell).
Please feel free to contact the stackage curators with any questions you may have
via the [stackage mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stackage),
or the [stackage gitter chat](https://gitter.im/commercialhaskell/stackage).
