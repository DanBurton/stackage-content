I'm happy to announce that the
[Stackage Curator team](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/blob/master/CURATORS.md)
is beginning a new blog. Until now, messages from the team have come
via our own personal blogs. From now on, our intention is to share
news and plans for changes to Stackage via this blog.

In addition to this broadcast mechanism, we intend to standardize
means of communicating back with the curator team, and for reaching
consensus on changes to the project. We'll be discussing those ideas
on this blog in the near future.
