The stackage curator team has started preparations for an LTS major bump
which will include ghc-8.6.2.

To give everyone some time to prepare, we are announcing the planned release date
as approximately **two to four weeks** from the date of this post.

Getting your package into the nightly snapshot will ensure its inclusion
in LTS 13 as well. To add your package, please submit a PR to
[commercialhaskell/stackage](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage).
To add your package to LTS 13 after it's released, please open a new issue
on [commercialhaskell/lts-haskell](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/lts-haskell).
Please feel free to contact the stackage curators with any questions you may have
via the [stackage mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stackage),
or the [stackage gitter chat](https://gitter.im/commercialhaskell/stackage).

For more insight into how stackage curators handle these sorts of things, see:
