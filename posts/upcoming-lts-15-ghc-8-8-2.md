The stackage curator team has started preparations for an LTS major
bump which will include ghc-8.8.2.

In addition to allowing new, breaking changes of packages into an LTS release,
this LTS 15 will [discontinue the legacy format for snapshots]
(https://www.stackage.org/blog/2020/02/discontinuing-legacy-snapshots).

To give everyone some time to prepare, we are announcing the planned release date
as approximately **two** from the date of this post.

Getting your package into the nightly snapshot will ensure its inclusion
in LTS 15 as well. To add your package, please submit a PR to
[commercialhaskell/stackage](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage).
To add your package to LTS 15 after it's released, please open a new issue
on [commercialhaskell/lts-haskell](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/lts-haskell).
Please feel free to contact the stackage curators with any questions you may have
via the [stackage mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stackage),
or the [stackage gitter chat](https://gitter.im/commercialhaskell/stackage).
