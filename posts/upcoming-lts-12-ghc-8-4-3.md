After a [recent discussion](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2018-June/129259.html)
on the Haskell-cafe mailing list, the stackage curator team has decided
to start the preparations for an LTS major bump which will include
ghc-8.4.3.

We'd like to give everyone enough time to prepare, which is why the
planned release date is **two weeks** from the date of this post.

As always, if you'd like to get your package added to an LTS snapshot,
please open a new issue on [commercialhaskell/lts-haskell](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/lts-haskell).

For those interested, here's an [overview](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/blob/master/CURATORS.md#new-lts-major-bump)
of the LTS major bump process we'll be adhering to from now on.
